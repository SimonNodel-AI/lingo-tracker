/**
 * Term file — the one way core reads and writes a project's term lists: the protected-terms
 * files and the preferred-terminology file. Both are a bare JSON array beside `.lingo-tracker.json`,
 * named by a config pointer with a default filename. This module owns what they share: pointer
 * resolution, the missing-file rule, the read (problems reported, never thrown), and the write
 * (2-space JSON, trailing newline, typed errors). A {@link TermFileKind} supplies what differs:
 * how the array's items are validated and normalized, and how a value is serialized.
 *
 * There is no cache. Each reader reads once per operation (the Translator when it opens, an
 * import or export run, one add or edit), and the files are a few hundred bytes, so a read costs
 * about what a stat would; a cache validated by stat would save nothing, and the unvalidated one
 * this replaced served stale terms to the API after a hand edit or `git pull`.
 *
 * @module term-file
