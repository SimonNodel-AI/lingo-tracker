/**
 * One change that a core write made to a translations folder.
 *
 * Each write returns the changes it made, so an in-memory view of the folder (the API's
 * Collection Index) can update itself without reading the disk again.
 * - `translationsFolder` is absolute. It identifies the collection that changed.
 * - `key` is a full dot-delimited resource key (`apps.common.ok`).
 * - `path` is a dot-delimited folder path (`apps.common`).
 * - `reindex` means that the change is too broad to describe (for example, a locale was added).
