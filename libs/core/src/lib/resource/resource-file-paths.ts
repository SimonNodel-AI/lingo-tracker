 * Resolves a resource key to its entry key and folder address.

 * This function encapsulates the logic for:
 * 1. Validating and combining targetFolder and key into a resolved key
 * 2. Splitting the resolved key into folder path and entry key
 * 3. Resolving the absolute folder path
 *
 * @param params - Path resolution parameters
 * @returns The folder address, resolved full key, entry key, and folder path segments
 * @throws {InvalidResourceKeyError} The key or target folder is malformed (domain message unchanged).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const paths = resolveResourcePaths({
 *   key: 'buttons.ok',
 *   translationsFolder: '/app/translations',
 *   targetFolder: 'apps.common',
 *   cwd: process.cwd()
 * });
 *
 * // Results:
 * // resolvedKey: "apps.common.buttons.ok"
 * // entryKey: "ok"
 * // folderPathSegments: ["apps", "common", "buttons"]
 * // folderPath: "/app/translations/apps/common/buttons"
 * ```
