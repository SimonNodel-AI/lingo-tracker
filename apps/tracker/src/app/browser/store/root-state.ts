 * Root state for signals shared across multiple features.

 *   isReadOnly: the open collection's settings, written only by the Browser Session
 *   (`with-browser-session.feature.ts`)
 * - sessionId: bumped by every `openCollection`; loaders capture it (`session-guard.ts`) and drop
 *   a response that arrives after another collection was opened
 * - currentFolderPath: the folder the list shows, or returns to after a search; written only by the
 *   List Scope (`with-list-scope.feature.ts`)
 * - densityMode and related: read by withFilterFeature (compact-mode locale tracking) and written by withViewPreferencesFeature
