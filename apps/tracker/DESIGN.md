# Design System: LingoTracker

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Watercolor Ledger"**

LingoTracker is a workbench for translation files that live in a developer's own repository, and its surfaces look like warm paper with careful ink on it. The page is parchment with a faint fractal-noise grain fixed over everything; panels and cards sit one tonal step off the page rather than floating on heavy shadows. Two pigments carry all the meaning: a coral/vermillion primary for the brand mark, the primary action, and the single top rule on every dialog, and a deep sky blue that is reserved for the keyboard focus ring, the input focus glow, and the "base locale" tint. Everything else is a warm neutral.

Density is operational, not editorial. Labels sit above their fields, groups are introduced by a short bold heading and a one-line hint, hints are 12px secondary ink, and anything that is a code or a path (locale codes, folder paths, file names) is set in IBM Plex Mono so it reads as data. The world is built over Angular Material (M2 theme, density -1), but the visible surfaces override Material chrome: dialogs drop their container padding, inputs are hand-drawn wells rather than Material outline fields, chips are the project's own pills.

Confirmed rejections from the shipped code: no hard offset shadows, no decorative gradients except the four-pigment header rule, no all-caps section headings, no Material outline fields inside the dialog family.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Parchment ground with a fixed paper-grain overlay in both themes.
- One accent (coral) for identity and the primary action; one accent (sky) for focus and "base".
- 3px coral top rule on every dialog panel; hairline (`1px --color-border`) separations everywhere else.
- Labels above fields; group heading + one-line hint introduces each section.
- Codes and paths in IBM Plex Mono at the surrounding size; prose in Nunito.
- Soft, warm-tinted shadows used only for lifted panels and hover; tonal steps convey depth at rest.
- Light and dark themes share one token set; the dark scale is the light neutral scale inverted.

## Colors

A warm parchment neutral scale carrying two pigments, coral and sky, with a quiet four-colour watercolor accent set used only for decoration.

### Primary
- **Coral / Vermillion** (`{colors.primary}`): the brand pigment. Used for the dialog top rule, filled primary buttons, the folder tile tint on cards and dialog headers (12% fill, 25% border), selected/hover card borders, and the base-locale left rule in the translation editor. Hover and active steps darken (`primary-hover`, `primary-active`).
- **Coral Text** (`{colors.primary-text}`): the text-weight coral. The fill tone only reaches 2.68:1 on a card, so any copy that must read as "primary" uses this instead (5.05:1). In dark theme the brightened primary already clears 4.5:1 and `primary-text` aliases it.
- **Coral Subtle** (`{colors.primary-subtle}`): a near-white blush for selected rows and soft highlights.

### Secondary
- **Deep Sky Blue** (`{colors.secondary}`): the attention pigment. It is the focus-ring colour (`{colors.focus-ring}` is the same value), the focused-input border and 22% glow, and the "base locale" chip tint (16% fill, 35% border, 45% mixed into the text). It is never a fill for a primary action.
- **Sky Subtle** (`{colors.secondary-subtle}`): info wells and soft secondary backgrounds.

### Tertiary
- **Amber Warning** (`{colors.warning}` / `{colors.warning-text}`): the "locked" hue. Read-only tiles use a 14% amber fill with `warning-text` ink; the switched-on read-only row mixes 6% amber into its ground and 35% into its border. `warning` itself is fill/border only (about 2.1:1 on parchment) and must never set type.
- **Error** (`{colors.error}`): invalid borders, error hints, the remove-chip hover.
- **Success / Info** (`{colors.success}`, `{colors.info}`): status glyphs and banners.

### Neutral
- **Parchment** (`{colors.parchment}`): the page and the card surface, the dialog panel in light theme, and the field well.
- **Parchment Subtle** (`{colors.parchment-subtle}`): the switch-row ground, text-chip fill, disclosure hover, and the dialog panel in dark theme (where it lifts one step above the page black).
- **Parchment Muted** (`{colors.parchment-muted}`): locale-chip fill and inline-code background.
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}`): titles, labels, field values, inline `<code>` in prose.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.ink-secondary}`): subtitles, hints, resting chip text, close/menu icons.
- **Ink Tertiary** (`{colors.ink-tertiary}`): decorative glyphs only (leading icons in inputs, chevrons, remove buttons at rest); at 2.5:1 it is not for text.
- **Ink Placeholder** (`{colors.ink-placeholder}`): placeholder copy, darker than tertiary so it clears 4.5:1.
- **Border / Border Subtle / Border Strong** (`{colors.border}`, `{colors.border-subtle}`, `{colors.border-strong}`): hairlines. Panels and rows use `border`; inner dividers use `border-subtle`; input wells and dashed empty states use `border-strong`.

### Status spine
- **New** (`{colors.status-new}`), **Stale** (`{colors.status-stale}`), **Translated** (`{colors.status-translated}`), **Verified** (`{colors.status-verified}`): every surface that reports a status reads these tokens, with `-on-dark` variants for the always-dark tooltip. `new` and `stale` keep saturated chip fills; `translated` and `verified` go near-neutral with the hue carried by ink and border only.

### Watercolor accents
- **Coral, Amber, Sky, Lavender, Sage** (`{colors.wc-coral}` and siblings): decorative pigments for the header rule gradient, empty-state rings, and splashes. Never used for controls or text.

### Named Rules
**The Two-Pigment Rule.** Coral means identity and the primary action; sky means focus and "base". A surface that uses coral for focus, or sky for a button, is off-world.

**The Text-Weight Rule.** Fill tones (`primary`, `warning`, `ink-tertiary`) never set type. Copy uses `primary-text`, `warning-text`, or `ink-secondary` and clears 4.5:1 on its own surface.

**The Status-Spine Rule.** A status colour comes from the `status-*` tokens and never from a local hex; `new` and `stale` are never conflated.

## Typography

**Brand Font:** Grechen Fuemen (with cursive fallback); the LingoTracker wordmark in the app header only.
**Body Font:** Nunito (with sans-serif fallback); every heading, label, control, and paragraph.
**Label/Mono Font:** IBM Plex Mono (with monospace fallback); locale codes, folder paths, file names, resource keys.

**Character:** Nunito's rounded terminals keep a data-heavy tool friendly; Plex Mono's stiffness makes codes and paths read as facts. The pairing is a handwritten ledger with typed entries. Grechen Fuemen never appears outside the wordmark.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (700, `clamp(1.75rem, 2.6vw, 2.25rem)`, 1.25, -0.02em): page titles ("Collections").
- **Headline** (600, 1.5rem, 1.25, -0.01em): dialog titles, shared by the translation editor and the collection form.
- **Title** (700, 1.125rem, 1.25, -0.01em): card names.
- **Group title** (700, 1rem, 1.375): the `h3` that opens a labelled group inside a form (Source, Locales, Options), always followed by a 12px hint.
- **Body** (400, 1rem, 1.5): field values, standard paragraphs.
- **Body small** (400, 0.875rem, 1.375): dialog subtitles, card path-adjacent copy.
- **Label** (600, 0.875rem, 1.5): field labels above inputs, disclosure titles, button text; switch labels step up to 700.
- **Caption** (400, 0.75rem, 1.375–1.5): group hints, field hints, errors, disclosure summaries, switch descriptions.
- **Tag** (600, 0.625rem, +0.05em, uppercase): the BASE tag inside a locale chip; the only uppercase text in the system, and it never leaves the chip.
- **Mono code** (600, 0.875rem): locale codes in chips and mono inputs.
- **Mono path** (400, 0.75rem, 1.45): folder paths on cards; two lines reserved so cards stay flush.

### Named Rules
**The Mono-Is-Data Rule.** Anything the file system or the config would spell out verbatim (locale code, folder path, file name, key) is set in IBM Plex Mono. Inside prose it is an inline `<code>` at 0.95em in `ink`, with no background, so the line height does not jump.

**The Label-Above Rule.** Form labels sit above their controls as 14px semibold Nunito. No floating labels, no placeholder-as-label.

## Layout

Pages are centred columns capped at 1400px with `--spacing-8` vertical and `--spacing-6` horizontal padding, dropping to `--spacing-6`/`--spacing-4` under 600px. The Collections page is an auto-fill grid of cards at `minmax(min(100%, 300px), 1fr)` with a `--spacing-5` gap.

Dialogs are fixed-width panels centred by the CDK overlay: the collection form is 540px (`max-width: min(540px, 100vw - 2 * --spacing-6)`, `max-height: min(90vh, 100dvh - 2 * --spacing-8)`); the translation editor is 700px and goes full-screen below 640px. Inside a dialog the column is header / scrolling body / footer, with the body owning the only scroll. Header padding is `--spacing-5 --spacing-6 --spacing-4`; body the same; footer `--spacing-4 --spacing-6 --spacing-5`.

Rhythm inside a form: groups stack at `--spacing-5`; within a group, heading-to-controls at `--spacing-3`; a field's label, control, and hint at `--spacing-1`; chips and inline controls at `--spacing-2`. Breakpoints follow the mixins in `styles/breakpoints.scss`: 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536px, mobile-first.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is tonal first, shadowed second. Panels, wells, and rows are placed one neutral step off their parent (page → card → well in light theme; page black → subtle panel → page-black well in dark theme) and separated by hairlines. Shadows are warm-tinted (`rgb(44 36 28 / …)` in light, black in dark), diffuse, and appear only on lifted panels and hover.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **sm** (`0 1px 3px 0 rgb(44 36 28 / 0.06)`): card at rest.
- **md** (`0 4px 8px -1px rgb(44 36 28 / 0.08), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(44 36 28 / 0.06)`): card hover with a 2px lift.
- **lg** (`0 10px 20px -3px rgb(44 36 28 / 0.1), 0 4px 8px -4px rgb(44 36 28 / 0.08)`): dialog panels.
- **xl**: defined, currently unused.
- **Focus glow** (`0 0 0 3px color-mix(in srgb, --color-secondary 22%, transparent)`): input and chip-editor focus; the error variant uses 18% of `error`.
- **Accent glow** (`0 6px 16px -4px color-mix(in srgb, --color-primary 45%, transparent)`): hover on the page's primary "Add" button only.

### Named Rules
**The Tonal-First Rule.** A surface at rest shows its depth by tone and hairline, not shadow. Shadows answer to state (hover, lifted overlay, focus).

**The Top-Rule Rule.** Every dialog panel carries exactly one `3px solid --color-primary` top border and zero container padding; the rule is the dialog's only decoration.

## Shapes

Soft, small radii scaled to the object: 4px for inline code, 6px for input wells, chip editors, and small tiles, 8px for cards' icon tiles, switch rows, disclosures, and dialog panels, 12px for collection cards, and full pills for every chip and the chip-add button. Borders are 1px hairlines; empty states (chip editor with no chips, the "+N" overflow chip, a locked value) switch to a dashed `border-strong` stroke rather than changing colour. Icon tiles are squares (38px header/card, 30px switch) with a translucent tint fill and a slightly stronger tint border in the same hue.

## Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** Material button shape (4px), density -1; the page-level "Add Collection" overrides to 8px with `--spacing-2 --spacing-5` padding.
- **Primary:** Material `mat-flat-button color="primary"`: coral fill with dark `ink-on-primary` label, 14px/500. Dark theme keeps the same light coral and the same dark ink.
- **Text:** `mat-button` in `ink-secondary`, hover to `ink`; used for Cancel and the close icon.
- **Hover / Focus:** colour steps via `--transition-fast` (150ms); the page "Add" button gains the accent glow and a 1px lift. Focus is the global 2px sky outline at 2px offset.
- **Footer convention:** right-aligned, Cancel then Primary, `--spacing-2` apart, above a `border` hairline.

### Chips
- **Locale chip:** full pill, `parchment-muted` fill, transparent 1px border, `ink-secondary` text; code in mono 14px/600 with `3px --spacing-2 3px --spacing-3` padding. Card variant is smaller (12px mono, `1px --spacing-2`).
- **Base variant:** sky tint (16% fill, 35% border, text mixed 45% toward sky) with an uppercase BASE tag at 10px; in edit mode a 14px lock glyph leads the code and the remove control is absent.
- **Text chip (tags, protected terms):** same pill, `parchment-subtle` fill, `border` hairline, Nunito 14px/500 in `ink`.
- **Remove control:** 24px round ghost button in `ink-tertiary`, hover to `error` on a 12% error tint.
- **Interactive chip:** in create mode a locale chip is a button; hover tints non-base chips 10% sky; `aria-pressed` marks the base.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 12px.
- **Background:** `parchment` (light) or 5% ink mixed into `parchment-subtle` (dark); hover mixes 3–8% coral into the ground.
- **Shadow Strategy:** `sm` at rest, `md` with a 2px lift on hover.
- **Border:** 1px `border`; hover mixes 40% coral into it. Read-only cards swap the icon tile to the amber tint.
- **Internal Padding:** `--spacing-5` (`--spacing-4` under 600px); footer separated by a `border-subtle` hairline holding the locale chips and a trailing arrow.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** label above (Label role), then a 40px well: 1px `border-strong`, 6px radius, `parchment` ground (`--dialog-well`), optional 18px leading glyph in `ink-tertiary`, `--spacing-2` gap, `0 --spacing-3` padding. Mono variant sets the value in Plex Mono 14px for paths.
- **Focus:** border to `secondary` plus the 22% sky glow, 150ms.
- **Error:** border to `error` with an 18% error glow; a 12px `error` hint with `role="alert"` replaces the normal hint.
- **Locked:** dashed border, transparent ground, `ink-secondary` value, leading lock glyph, and a hint explaining the lock.
- **Hint:** 12px `ink-secondary`; optional 14px leading glyph; file names inside it are inline `<code>`.
- **Page filter field:** the Collections filter uses a coral focus mix instead of sky (see drift note).

### Chip editor
A wrapping well with the same stroke, radius, ground, and focus glow as a text input, `--spacing-2` padding and gap. Chips come first; the inline add row (18px plus glyph, borderless 30px input, optional 28px pill "Add" button that appears once text is typed) flexes to fill the remaining space at a 180px minimum. Empty editors show a dashed stroke. Tags and protected terms reuse it with text chips.

### Labelled group
A `section` with an `h3` in Group-title role and an optional 12px `ink-secondary` hint stacked at 2px, then controls at `--spacing-3`. Groups stack at `--spacing-5`. This is how a form reads top to bottom without dividers.

### Switch row
A `parchment-subtle` panel, 1px `border`, 8px radius, `--spacing-3 --spacing-4` padding: 30px amber lock tile, then a 14px/700 label over a 12px description, then a Material slide toggle. When on, the row mixes 6% amber into its ground and 35% into its border over 200ms. The tile is the lock's colour in every locked context (cards, dialogs).

### Disclosure row
A 1px `border`, 8px-radius container with a full-width toggle: 18px leading glyph, 14px/600 title, a right-aligned 12px count summary ("2 tags · 0 terms" or "None yet"), and a chevron that rotates 180° over 200ms. The open panel is separated by a `border-subtle` hairline, padded `--spacing-2 --spacing-4 --spacing-4`, and fades in 4px over 200ms (disabled under reduced motion).

### Dialog anatomy
Panel (see Layout for widths) with zero Material padding, a 3px coral top rule, and `lg` shadow. Header: 38px coral tile with a 19px glyph, Headline title, one-line Body-small subtitle in `ink-secondary`, absolutely positioned close button at `--spacing-3`, hairline below. Body: the scrolling column of labelled groups. Footer: hairline above, right-aligned Cancel + Primary. The translation editor shares the top rule, title, subtitle, close, and hairlines; the collection form adds the header tile.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** open every dialog with the 3px coral top rule, zero container padding, `lg` shadow, and the header / hairline / body / hairline / footer column.
- **Do** put labels above controls at 14px/600 and hints below at 12px `ink-secondary`.
- **Do** set locale codes, paths, and file names in IBM Plex Mono; inline them in prose as `<code>` at 0.95em in `ink` with no background.
- **Do** use sky blue for focus (2px outline, or border plus 22% glow on wells) and for the base-locale tint; use coral for the primary action and identity.
- **Do** mark locked and read-only states with the amber lock tile (14% amber fill, `warning-text` ink) so they are unmistakable.
- **Do** reuse the locale pill for any locale, the text chip for any word-like tag, and the chip editor for any editable list.
- **Do** place surfaces one neutral step off their parent and separate them with 1px hairlines before reaching for a shadow.
- **Do** honour `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling reveal animations and hover lifts.

### Don't:
- **Don't** set type in `primary`, `warning`, or `ink-tertiary`; use the text-weight tokens.
- **Don't** use Material outline form fields inside the dialog family; the label-above well is the field.
- **Don't** use uppercase or letterspaced text outside the BASE tag inside a chip.
- **Don't** use Grechen Fuemen anywhere but the wordmark.
- **Don't** add hard offset shadows, gradients on controls, or a second accent rule on a dialog.
- **Don't** hard-code a status hue; read the `status-*` tokens.
