/**
 * Validates translation completeness and readiness for production release.
 *
 * This command performs comprehensive validation of ALL translation resources across
 * ALL configured collections and target locales. It serves as a quality gate in CI/CD
 * pipelines to ensure only complete, verified translations are deployed to production.
 *
 * **Validation Process:**
 * 1. Loads configuration from .lingo-tracker.json
 * 2. Opens every collection with its own base locale and target locales
 * 3. Validates EVERY resource of each collection in EVERY one of its target locales
 * 4. Collects ALL failures and warnings
 * 5. Displays complete validation summary
 * 6. Exits with code 1 if any failures found, 0 if all passed
 *
 * **Validation Rules:**
 * - 'new' status → FAILURE (resource not yet translated)
 * - 'stale' status → FAILURE (translation out of sync with source)
 * - 'translated' status → FAILURE (default) or WARNING (with --allow-translated)
 * - 'verified' status → SUCCESS (translation reviewed and approved)
 * - Missing metadata → treated as 'new' (FAILURE)
 * - Folder whose files cannot be read (malformed JSON) → FAILURE (its resources are not validated)
 * - Value does not compile as ICU for its own locale → FAILURE (unless --skip-icu)
 * - Translation interpolates different placeholders than its base value → FAILURE (unless --skip-placeholders)
 * - Translation drops or alters a protected term → FAILURE (unless --skip-protected-terms)
 * - Base-locale value uses a discouraged term from the preferred-terminology file → WARNING (never fails)
 * - Preferred-terminology file exists but cannot be loaded → FAILURE
 *
 * **ICU Validation:**
 * Status validation asks whether a human approved a translation. It says
 * nothing about whether the stored value renders. Plural categories are a
 * property of the language — `one` selects 1 in 'en', 0 and 1 in 'fr', and
 * does not exist in 'ja' or 'ko' — so a value copied between locales can be
 * marked 'verified' and still throw. Every value, including the base-locale
 * source, is compiled under the locale it is stored under.
 *
 * **Preferred Terminology:**
 * Each collection's base-locale values are scanned for discouraged terms from
 * the preferred-terminology file. Findings are advisory — reported once per
 * key and rule, never affecting the exit code. A file that exists but cannot be
 * loaded is a failure, because then nothing was checked. There is no opt-out flag.
 *
 * **Exit Codes:**
 * - 0: All validations passed (all resources verified); terminology warnings allowed
 * - 1: Status, ICU, placeholder, or protected-term failures, unreadable preferred-terminology file, OR configuration errors
 *
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Pre-release quality gate in CI/CD pipelines
 * - Automated translation completeness checks
 * - Prevent deployment of incomplete translations
 * - Enforce translation verification requirements
 *
 * Options: status strictness, locale and ICU flags. Every failure sets exit code 1.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Strict validation (default) - requires all verified
 * await validateCommand({ allowTranslated: false });
 *
 * // Relaxed validation - allow translated status with warnings
 * await validateCommand({ allowTranslated: true });
 *
 * // Skip ICU compilation; other checks still apply
 * await validateCommand({ skipIcu: true });
 * ```
 *
 * @example CLI Usage
 * ```bash
 * # Strict mode (production releases)
 * $ lingo-tracker validate
 *
 * # Relaxed mode (staging environments)
 * $ lingo-tracker validate --allow-translated
 *
 * # Skip ICU compilation; other checks still apply
 * $ lingo-tracker validate --skip-icu
 *
 * # Skip placeholder agreement; other checks still apply
 * $ lingo-tracker validate --skip-placeholders
 *
 * # Skip protected-term preservation; other checks still apply
 * $ lingo-tracker validate --skip-protected-terms
 *
 * # Also warn about base-locale plurals that will not survive being copied
 * $ lingo-tracker validate --require-portable-plurals
 *
 * # In CI pipeline
 * $ lingo-tracker validate || exit 1
 * ```
